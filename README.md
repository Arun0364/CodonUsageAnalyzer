# 🧬 Codon Usage Analyzer

A Python-based bioinformatics tool that analyzes **codon usage frequencies** in DNA coding sequences (CDS).  
The script counts codons, calculates usage bias, and generates **bar plots, heatmaps, and comparison plots** between species or genes.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Accepts **FASTA DNA sequences** as input  
- Counts codon frequencies and converts them to relative usage (%)  
- Generates:
  - Codon usage barplots (per sequence)
  - Codon usage heatmaps (codon table layout)
  - Side-by-side barplots for two sequences
  - Difference heatmaps showing codon bias shifts
- Exports results to CSV and PNG

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Run the program
```bash
python3 codon_usage.py
```

### 3. Provide input FASTA files
You will be prompted for:
First FASTA file path + label (e.g., Human_HBB.fasta, "Human")
Second FASTA file path + label (optional, e.g., Mouse_HBB.fasta, "Mouse")

## 📊 Example Outputs

+ codon_usage_Human.csv → raw counts + frequency table
+ codon_plot_Human.png → codon barplot
+ codon_heatmap_Human.png → codon heatmap
+ codon_comparison.png → side-by-side barplot (if 2 sequences given)
+ codon_diff_heatmap.png → codon bias difference heatmap

## 🛠️ Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Biopython
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Install via:

```bash
pip3 install biopython pandas seaborn matplotlib

```

## ⚙️ How It Works

The Codon Usage Analyzer follows a simple step-by-step pipeline:

### 1. Input FASTA file(s)

* User provides one or two DNA coding sequences in FASTA format.

### 2. Parse DNA sequence
* The script reads the file and extracts the coding sequence.

### 3. Count codons (triplets)
* DNA sequence is split into non-overlapping codons (e.g., ATG | GTC | ...).
* Each codon occurrence is tallied.

### 4. Calculate codon frequencies (%)
* Codon counts are normalized into percentage frequencies for comparison.

### 5. Export results
* A CSV file is generated with codon counts and frequencies.

### 6. Generate visualizations
+ Barplots: Frequency distribution of codons
+ Heatmaps: Codon usage in codon table order
+ Comparison plots: Side-by-side codon usage (if two sequences are given)
+ Difference heatmaps: Frequency differences (Species 1 − Species 2)

### 7. Save outputs
* All CSVs and plots are written to the outputs/ directory.
